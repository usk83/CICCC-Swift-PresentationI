# Designing Algorithms - Presentation I

[Presentation I.pdf](./Presentation%20I.pdf)

## Topic 1: Find the smallest/largest  M elements in a stream of  N items.

- Your algorithm should not exceed the following complexity.
    - Time: O(NlgM)
    - Space: O(M)
- You can think of a stream of items as stdin.
- You are allowed to use any data structures/algorithms of your choice.

## Topic 2: Find the substring pattern of length  M in a text of length  N. ( Assume that N >= M) (Return the index of the starting index)

- Your algorithm should not exceed the following complexity.
  - Time: Linear time O(N) or O(N+M)
    - Can NOT be O(N*M)
  - Space: O(M)
    - Optional: You can try to get the starting index without backing up the current string youâ€™re processing.
- You are allowed to use any data structures/algorithms of your choice.
